This is a "quick and dirty" tool for selling Contact Lenses.

The intent is to allow the doctor or optician to QUICKLY calculate the cost for disposable contact
lenses for a patient.  Research has shown that patients are more likely to change their contact lenses
*ON TIME* when they purchase the year supply, than when they don't.  My personal experience in
private practice optometry in the United States is that it more profitable for the practice when
they order their annual supply at the conclusion of their examination.  (i.e. it costs the practice
money each time they place an order -- additional postage, staff time to take the order, place the order,
notify the patient when the order is here, and dispensing the order)

Therefore, in our office we strive to sell the year supply so much so that we extend a 20% discount when the patient
opts fot that year supply.  We offer $0.00 discount when partial year supplies are purchased.  Combine this with the
manufacturer rebates, and the incentive for the annual supply is maximized.

Since our practice began using this approach for selling contact lenses, we have achieved 80.19% capture rate for
annual supplies of contact lenses.  We would LOVE to help you do the same.

I wrote this project to learn django.  I would enjoy feedback from a django expert on ways to improve this tool.

Features I'd like to have

  -- filtering the lenses in the selection pannel by their attributes.
  
  -- ability to compare multiple lenses at the same time (or add other 'quotes' to the existing quote)
  
  -- improve appearance -- current version (ain't got no alibi it's) u-g-l-y.
